			<detail>This is Mike. Mike is a drug dealer. Not a biggy, but still he is doing his job good.</detail>
			<detail>Beneath drug dealing he had some police records going on. He stole, fought and almost killed.</detail>
			<detail>He is the stereotypical guy who just cause problems and cannot control his anger so he always get into bizarre/ dangerous situations.</detail>
			<detail>He does not really think of the consequences that can happen with his actions.</detail>
			<detail>No one really knows why he is stealing and fighting.</detail>
			<detail>I guess it is one of the cases where he does not know that else to do with his life.</detail>
